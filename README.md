# PCBS-ExpansionMod-Linux

This was the Linux install script for the [Hardware Expansion Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/pcbuildingsimulator/mods/82) for PC Building Simulator.

Before the author of the mod change the installation to a drag and drop style solution, you needed to have Java installed which would replace the files one by one.
Since they only included a bat file to do the installation, I figured to write a Linux installation script for this.
